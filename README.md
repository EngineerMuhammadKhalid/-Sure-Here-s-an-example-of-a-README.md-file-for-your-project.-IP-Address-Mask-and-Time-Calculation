IP Address Mask and Time Calculation
This project provides a utility to process and calculate subnet masks and saved time based on IP addresses provided in an input file. It handles various test cases, validates IP addresses, and performs bitwise operations to generate subnet masks and calculate the saved time.

Features
Validates a list of IPv4 addresses.
Calculates subnet masks for a range of given values.
Computes the saved time based on the difference in subnet masks.
Handles multiple test cases.
Outputs the results to a specified file.
Project Structure
main.py: The main Python script that handles IP address validation, subnet mask calculations, and time savings.
newinput.txt: Example input file containing test cases, nodes (IP addresses), and subnet mask ranges.
output12.txt: Example output file where the results are written.
How It Works
Input File (newinput.txt): The input file should follow this structure:

The first line contains an integer t, the number of test cases.
For each test case:
The first line contains two integers: n (number of nodes) and k (the number of nodes to compare).
The next n lines contain the IP addresses.
The final line contains the initial and final subnet mask values.
Output File (output12.txt): For each test case, the output includes:

A list of subnet masks in dot-decimal notation.
A list of saved times for each subnet mask.
Any invalid IP addresses detected in the input.
Functions
validate_ip(ip)
Validates whether a given string is a valid IPv4 address. Returns True if the IP is valid, otherwise False.

calculate_mask_and_time(nodes, k, initial_mask, final_mask)
Calculates the subnet masks for the range from initial_mask to final_mask. Also calculates the "saved time" based on the difference in subnet masks.

ip_to_binary(ip)
Converts an IP address to its binary representation.

calculate_saved_time(subnet1, subnet2)
Calculates the saved time by comparing two subnet masks and counting the differing bits.

main(input_file, output_file)
Main driver function that reads the input file, processes each test case, and writes the results to the output file.

Requirements
Python 3.x
No external libraries required. The script uses Python's built-in ipaddress module.
Usage
Prepare an input file (newinput.txt) in the following format:
